# Spawning & Settlement Dynamics

## 🗓️ 1. Spawning Calendars (2024-2025 Predictions)
Spawning is a high-precision event triggered by the **Neural Link** of Lunar Cycles, SST, and Solar Insolation.

| Genus | Primary Window | Environmental Cue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acropora** | April - August (Caribbean) / Oct - Dec (GBR) | 3-4 days post-full moon; 80-190m post-sunset |
| **Porites** | Nov - Jan (Peak January) | Global synchronized event (Predicted Jan 18-19, 2025) |
| **Montipora** | Late Spring / Summer | 1-3 nights post-full moon (Hawaii) |
| **Pocillopora** | April - May | Morning (~7:30 AM) during full moon period |

## 🧲 2. Settlement Induction
Larvae (Planulae) require specific cues to transition from swimming to polyps.

### Biological Cues (The "Smell" of Success)
*   **Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA)**: Required by species like *Acropora cytherea*. They identify bacterial communities on *Titanoderma prototypum*.
*   **Bacterial Reef Ink (Brink)**: Photopolymerized hydrogels that cultivate specific bacterial strains, increasing settlement by **500%**.

### Chemical Cues
*   **SNAP-X Technology**: Replicates the chemical landscape of healthy reefs using bioactive molecules.
*   **Glycoglycerolipids**: Specific polysaccharides that act as "attraction beacons" for larvae.

## ⚖️ 3. Larval Competency
The window for settlement ranges from **4 days** to **70+ days** depending on the species reproductive mode (Broadcast spawning vs. Brooding).
