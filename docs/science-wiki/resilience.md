# Climate Resilience & Risk Mitigation

## 🌡️ 1. Thermal Tolerance Management
The ReefMaker Brain monitors **Degree Heating Weeks (DHW)** to predict bleaching probability.
*   **Risk Tiers**:
    *   **Tier 1 (Recovery Focus)**: Low DHW. Prioritize nutrient delivery for biomass growth.
    *   **Tier 2 (Stress Management)**: Moderate DHW. Increase Alginate hydration to prevent desiccation.
    *   **Tier 3 (Survival Logic)**: High DHW. Trigger UV-Filter (CoralStick) to mitigate radiation stress.

## 🧪 2. Acidification Buffering
*   **Mechanism**: The C-Brick substrate releases localized pH buffers (Calcium Carbonate + Trace Minerals) to neutralize acidity in the larval boundary layer.
*   **Goal**: Ensure calcification can continue even in high CO2 scenarios.

## 🛡️ 3. Refugia Identification
Using NOAA satellite indices, ReefMaker identifies "Thermal Refugia"—areas naturally protected from heatwaves by upwelling or currents.
*   **Strategy**: Focus the densest restoration efforts in Refugia to ensure "Seed Banks" for future recruitment.

## 🤖 4. Real-time Monitoring (Omics)
Integration of "Point-of-Care" omics tools for real-time monitoring of:
*   Coral Disease detection.
*   Reproductive readiness.
*   Thermal stress Biomarkers.
