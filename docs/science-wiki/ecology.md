# Restoration Ecology & Methodology

## 🌊 1. "Reefs of Hope" Strategy
Endorsed in 2024, this strategy focuses on accelerating the natural processes of adaptation. Rather than just replanting, it emphasizes creating ecosystems that can recover from Intensifying Marine Heat Waves (IMHW).

## 🧬 2. Assisted Gene Flow (AGF)
A critical intervention discussed in *Science* (July 2025). 
*   **Mechanism**: Managed movement of coral individuals with high thermal tolerance to cooler areas or areas facing rapid warming.
*   **Goal**: Boosting genetic diversity and accelerating the "evolutionary speed" of the reef.

## 📍 3. Optimized Outplanting
Research published in Late 2024 emphasizes that **Location > Quantity**.
*   **Key Parameters**:
    *   **Depth**: Prioritize shallower depths for light-dependent species.
    *   **Flow**: Faster currents facilitate nutrient exchange and waste removal (waste-gas exchange).
    *   **Nutrients**: Low-nutrient environments prevent macroalgae competition.

## 🏗️ 4. Hybrid Artificial Reefs
Integration of nature-based solutions with engineered structures (like C-Bricks) provides immediate coastal protection while natural coral takes hold.
