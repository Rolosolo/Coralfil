# Material Science & Biomimicry (The Coralfill Matrix)

## 🧪 1. Alginate Hydrogels
Harvested from brown algae, alginate provides the "biological storage" within C-Bricks and CoralStick.
*   **Hydration**: Cross-linked with Calcium ions (CaAlg), it stores water and nutrients, maintaining a favorable micro-environment during bleaching events.
*   **Attraction**: Used to encapsulate CCA metabolites for controlled release (The "Slow-Scent" strategy).

## 🧬 2. Chitosan Binders
A biocompatible polymer derived from chitin.
*   **Structural Bond**: Used as a non-toxic alternative to petroleum-based epoxies.
*   **Water Quality**: Chitosan reduces turbidity at the restoration site without impacting coral health (biocompatible with *Porites lobata*).
*   **Scaffold Proliferation**: Chitosan/Coral composites enhance cell proliferation and growth rates.

## 🧊 3. 3D Micro-Architecture
*   **Hydrodynamic Flow**: Millimeter-scale ridged topographies change flow patterns, making settlement **significantly more likely**.
*   **Porosity**: Elevated porosity (Geopolymer-based) leads to a **78.5% increase** in larval settlement.
*   **Acoustic Mimicry**: Designing structures that naturally amplify "healthy reef sounds" to attract pelagic larvae.

## ⚡ 4. Mineral Accretion Technology (MAT)
ReefMaker integrates low-voltage electrical field logic to accelerate growth by up to **400%**, using conductive pastes that harden without requiring massive metal frames.
